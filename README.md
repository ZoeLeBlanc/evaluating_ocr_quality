# Experiments to Evaluate OCR Quality

How do we evaluate OCR in DH?

What are the tradeoffs of different methods?

How does OCR even work?

This repository is my attempt to answer these questions. I'm hoping to eventually present this work as a blog post to get feedback and then maybe even a python library depending on interest.

If you have any interest or advice, please reach out!!!
